# Health-Insurance-Cost-Predictor
Developed a Health Insurance Cost Predictor 

## Objective:
- Develop a high-accuracy (>97%) predictive model. The percentage difference between the predicted and actual value on a minimum of 95% of the errors should be less than10%.
- Deploy the model in the cloud so that an insurance underwriter can run it from anywhere.
- Create an interactive Streamlit application that an underwriter can use for predictions.

## Achivements
- Score (accuracy): 99.26% on Training Data and  98.75% on Testing Data
- Error margin: 1.63%
- XGBoost Regressor Outperform Linear Regression with ~1% margin of score (98.85% and 98.82) on Traing and Testing data.
